## A Windows Universal App for Debate Timekeeping
Debate Timekeeper is a Windows Universal App (currently only works on Windows Phone 8.1+) that allows debaters/judges to automatically ring a bell a specified number of times after a certain time limit has been reached.

This as well as an older version for WP7 and WP8 have total downloads of over 1k.

It is still available in the Windows Store here : http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=27dc9ddb-ebc7-4a77-8098-3b749d21f9aa
